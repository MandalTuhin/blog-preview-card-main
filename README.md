## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The use of clamp() for responsive typography and widths.
- That I cannot put div inside a paragraph tag.
- That margins overlap when two elements with margins are adjacent to each other, but padding does not overlap.
- That I should use margins for spacing outside an element and padding for spacing inside an element.
- That some elements have default margin and padding applied by the browser, which can be reset using CSS.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving at:

- CSS layouts (especially grid for more complex designs).
- Writing cleaner, scalable CSS for bigger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) - This helped me in understanding how to use different CSS properties.
